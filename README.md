# Biopython usage/Jupyter-notebook

This repository contains various scripts for processing FASTA files containing protein or nucleotide sequences in a Jupyter Notebook environment using the Biopython package (version 1.82). These scripts were used in some of my computational projects. Feel free to share them with your colleagues and coding affiliates. The code would be avaliable for copy-paste at Jupyter notebook environment - thus there is now script to download (e.g. in .py format). Before delving into the code, ensure that you have installed the Biopython package:

1) Using pip
   pip install biopython
2) Using conda
   conda install -c conda-forge biopython

Verifying installation:

import Bio
print(Bio.__version__)
