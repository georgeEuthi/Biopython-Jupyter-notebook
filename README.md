# Biopython usage/Jupyter-notebook

This repository contains various scripts for processing FASTA files containing protein or nucleotide sequences in a Jupyter Notebook environment using the Biopython package (version 1.82). 

**WARNING:** All rights to Biopython are held by its authors and contributors (for more information please visit: https://biopython.org/wiki/Documentation)

These scripts were used in some of my computational projects. Feel free to share them with your colleagues and coding affiliates. The code would be avaliable for copy-paste at Jupyter notebook environment - thus there is now script to download (e.g. in .py format). Before delving into the code, ensure that you have installed the Biopython package:

1) Using pip:
  
   pip install biopython

2) Using conda:
   
   conda install -c conda-forge biopython

Verifying installation:

import Bio

print(Bio.__version__)
