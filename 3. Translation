### First, import the necessary modules: SeqIO from Bio to handle fasta files and CodonTable from Bio.Data to facilitate translation, 
and colored from termcolor to improve the visualization of sequence IDs. Then, load the nucleotides fasta file and parse its sequences. 
Next, we utilize the CodonTable module to access the standard genetic code table for translation. We customize the translation process 
by changing the default stop codon symbol from '*' to '' for better compatibility with downstream bioinformatics tools. Finally, translate 
each sequence and print them alongside their corresponding IDs, enhancing clarity with colored visualization for easier analysis. ###

from Bio import SeqIO
from Bio.Data import CodonTable
from termcolor import colored

fasta_file_path = "C:path/nucleotides.fasta"

with open (fasta_file_path) as nucleotides:
    nuc_sequences = list(SeqIO.parse(nucleotides, "fasta"))
    for nuc_seq in nuc_sequences:
        print(colored(nuc_seq.id,'black',attrs = ['bold']))                                            
        print(colored("Nucleotide sequence:", 'blue'))
        print(nuc_seq.seq)
        print(colored("Protein sequence:", 'green'))
        prot_sequences = nuc_seq.seq.translate(table= "Standard", stop_symbol = '')
        print(prot_sequences)
        print("\t")
