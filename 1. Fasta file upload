###### Upload the desired fasta file from your desktop. Ensure that the correct 
separators are included in the absolute path, spesifically "/" or "\\" and not 
the "\", which is translated as en escape character in Python language e.g.
correct: "C:/your path/file.fasta" or "C:\\your path\\file.fasta"
wrong: "C:\your path\file.fasta" ######

# Improt the SeqIO module 
from Bio import SeqIO
help(SeqIO)

# Parse the fasta file using the absolute path and create a list containing all the seauences. The "id" command is used to determine the sequence id 
with open ("C:your path/file.fasta") as example:
    sequences = list(SeqIO.parse(example, "fasta"))
    for seq in sequences:
        print(seq.id)

    print("\t")

# Find the number of total sequences in the selected fasta file
    number_seq = len(sequences)
    print("Total number of sequences:", number_seq)
